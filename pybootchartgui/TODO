** Bugs:

* FIXME: are we merging / glupping threads properly ?
	+ how can sreadahead apparently be doing no I/O ? :-)

	+ extend rectangles in rendered output to note when
	  processes truly exit to improve duration rendering.
		+ expand the tasks API for this.

* Tracing metrics:
	+ traced %d processes of $$ (!) :-)
	+ consumed %d seconds of CPU [ render these ... ]

	+ horizontal zoom - should keep view horiz centered:
	  but does not - cf. set_xscale

	+ merge processes for CPU counts:
		+ if the ns count is -identical- (and non-zero) it is the same process
			+ need to back-merge somehow ?
			+ 'forked' ? ...
			+ or can we do this by pid ? [ prolly ! ]

	+ fix cumulative graphing - and boundary box bits

	+ re-write ever more of bootchartd from shell into C ...
		+ make the --dump thing return a success status,
		+ poll the remote process (with ptrace ? - hmm ...)
			+ to see if it has finished (?)
			+ a good idea ? or will it introduce error ?
			+ hmm.
		+ have a 20 second delay before starting to poll it ?

** Features:

Add some tabs to the interactive renderer to show the raw files:
kernel dmesg, header, and perhaps the full (processed) cmdline2 log

Use the same stats that Intel's tracer uses of I/O / scheduling foo ...
	+ use them to avoid taskstats polling if there has been
	  no scheduled timeslice (?)

Graph the swap / I/O delay stuff inside the bar (?)

Account for the time taken to run the bootchart-collector ...
	+ scale all other times by this ammount [!] ;-)
	+ to make it -appear- as if it doesn't impact the system :-)

* render I/O data backwards ... :-)
	+ back-propagate delays that are longer than a rendered slice 

Scale time discontinuously ? [ make the first seconds much longer ? ]
	+ fun ! :-)

Remove 'merge_logger' - no longer necessary - it's just one app ...
	+ potentially we should hide / remove it though :-)

* Better data processing / shrinkage:
	+ post process in C code as we dump the data
	+ why process the data in python ? can't we do it earlier ?
		+ adjust the previous sample etc.
	+ /proc/stat post-processing:
		+ which fields do we actually parse & need ?

Process taskstats in advance
	+ elide all non-useful lines:
		+ ie. no-changes in various fields

* Export ODF, with a number of pie charts in it etc.
	+ export cumulative data for rendering in ods ?
	+ rather than adding manual rendering - which sucks (!?)
	+ fun ... :-)


Notes:
	+ SUSE initrd debugging; use "'shell=1'" - is dead good ...
