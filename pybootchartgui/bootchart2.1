.TH BOOTCHART2 1 2011-03-07
.SH NAME
bootchart2 \- collects and analyses data from boot process
.SH DESCRIPTION
bootchart2 is a tool to log the boot process and make a nice
graph out of it, to usually see where it takes longer.
.br
It consists of three different pieces of software:
a shell script, a collector and a visualisation tool.
.br
Please also see the manual pages referred to in the \fBSEE ALSO\fR
section.
.SH CONFIGURATION
After install simply add these options to your kernel command line, normally in \fI/boot/grub/menu.lst:
.in +4n
.nf

.B "initcall_debug printk.time=y quiet init=/sbin/bootchartd ..."

.fi
.in
Then after bootup run pybootchartgui to get an interactive
chart rendering tool.
If you want to chart the initrd, add
.in +4n
.nf

.B rdinitrd=/sbin/bootchartd

.fi
.in
to the kernel command line.
.PP
To make bootchart2 work best, please ensure your kernel is 
configured with
.I CONFIG_PROC_EVENTS=y
and
.I CONFIG_TASKSTATS=y
.
.PP
If you want to start bootchart2 in a dracut (version >= 008)
initramfs, you have to change
.I init=/sbin/bootchartd
to
.I rdinit=/sbin/bootchartd
and regenerate the initramfs with bootchart support with:
.in +4n
.nf

.B "# dracut -f -a bootchart"

.fi
.in
